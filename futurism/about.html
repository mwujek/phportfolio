          <div class="col-md-8 col col-md-offset-2" style="font-size:1.1em"><p style="text-indent:20px">While researching for this project, I tried to find a manifesto that could be translated into typographic form with motion. Several artist movements and declarations address movement, motion, and change, but the futurist manifesto presented an array of possibilities that could be crafted in a web browser. The essence and themes of the Futurist manifesto lends itself to aggressive motion, disarray, and destruction. All of these words, in a sense, can be related to experimental design and how a designer goes about creating a new (typographic) composition. By deconstructing contrastive guidelines and creating chaos, expressive new forms are developed.</p>

<p style="text-indent:20px">The web, a medium that is fundamentally built on standards and rules, is only able to display a turbulent impression of motion—breaking visual guidelines still requires obedience to web standards. The biggest challenge was making this site responsive and cross-browser compatible while maintaining predictable and consistent visual identity. While designing I approached this project with four major steps or guidelines.</p>
<hr>
<ol style="padding-left:25px"> 
<li>Researching, gathering, and organizing content</li>
<li>Sketching ideas and layout on paper and Illustrator</li>
<li>Using a third-party framework (Bootstrap 3) to minimize development time</li>
<li>Making a "skeleton template" and filling in content afterwards</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-indent:20px">While I was sketching, I thought about the user and how they might want to navigate through the site. What would encourage interaction? How might they want to navigate through the different pages? Are all of the pages accessible? How will this look on a smaller screen? Larger screen? Considering all of these possibilities helped refine my design choices. The navigation on the left side of the page allows the user to focus on the pages content without distracting and directing them to the next page or step of the manifesto. The site isn't necessarily meant to viewed in a linear fashion—I intended for the pages to be independent of each other for user exploration and observation.</p>

<p style="text-indent:20px">The animations on this site were difficult because there are a lot of components to coding an animation and designing unique animations wasn't easy. </p>

<p style="text-indent:20px">Overall, I'm happy with the design of this site and hope you like it too!</p>
