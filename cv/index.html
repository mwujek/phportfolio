                <p>&#8220;What an absolute pleasure it has been to work with Matt and see the amazing website for my business come together quickly and without any stress (on my end, at least). It has been so easy to collaborate with him, to tell him my needs, ideas, vision, and how my clients need the site to function to get them into the door. Matt's ability to integrate not only a super functional blog interface but also, and most importantly, our external booking site for classes and workshops has made the transition from curiosity to client commitment so much simpler. His clean, edited, and stylish design aesthetic has proven time and again to impress potential clients and bring them into the studio.</p>

<p>Working with Matt has been a match from day one, and I couldn't be happier. I highly recommend him to any of my friends, clients, or business connections who are looking for a designer who genuinely cares about his work; from the initial steps of creating the concept, communication, and ideal personalized functionality to a clear aesthetic that represents their branding. Matt will be my designer for as long as he will take on my projects!&#8221;</p>

Matt was a highly self-motivated and self-learning individual who brought a lot of enthusiasm and skill to the class. During the course of my class, Matt pushed his skills far beyond where he started and the requirements of the course, asked meaningful questions, and made himself available as a tutor to other students, sometimes at the expense of his own work. Matt excelled at every level and rose to every challenge in this class and I am confident that he would succeed and add value to any project he choses to apply himself to.&#8221;</p>

Over the course of two years, I designed over 50 products, maintained a social media campaign and collaborated with other artists and manufacturers.

When I was 12 years old, I started picking strawberries in the summer and continued that job until I was 16. After that I painted houses during high school and bused tables through college. During my college summers I worked on the Nibler's farm and I drove a semi-truck on the Blue Moutains in Walla Walla, Washington. Before working there, I hadn't even driven a manual transmission. I quickly learned how to operate the colossal 12-geared vehicle on the open hillside and miracleously avoided any serious mishaps; however, I fell out of the cab once or twice...destroying my glasses and lunch box.
