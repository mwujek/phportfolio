              <h2>Ian Pollock</h2>
              <h3>New Media Educator / Artist</h3>
              <p>&#8220;I had the pleasure of having Matt as a student in my class at USF. Matt was a highly self-motivated and self-learning individual who brought a lot of enthusiasm and skill to the class. During the course of my class, Matt pushed his skills far beyond where he started and the requirements of the course, asked meaningful questions, and made himself available as a tutor to other students, sometimes at the expense of his own work. Matt excelled at every level and rose to every challenge in this class and I am confident that he would succeed and add value to any project he choses to apply himself to.&#8221;</p>

              <p>&#8220;Matt was a service-learning student working with Quesada Gardens Initiative. He went way beyond the requirements of service. He crafted graphics and helped get an ecommerce site going, and we loved everything he did.&#8221;</p>

              <h3>Owner &#64; Revolver Yoga</h3>
              <p>&#8220;Matt is an incredibly talented web and graphic designer. I hired him to build a website for my yoga studio, which he did quickly, efficiently, and professionally. The site works perfectly and has everything (and more!) that I asked from him. His creativity is limitless and I have no doubt that he will become a very well-known, go-to designer for many companies within a short period of time. I absolutely believe that Matt is one of the most talented young designers I have met in the past 5 years of working in graphic and branding design.&#8221;</p>

Due to the fast turnaround of on-campus events and activites, these assignments are always finished in a timely manner. I have designed unique apparel, posters, and other stationary for many of the clubs and students groups on campus. I also redesigned the Graphics Center's website, focusing on usability and a responsive layout for multiple devices.</li>

        <li>In the summer of 2013, I was an Intern at the USF Publication Department at the Office of Communications &amp; Marketing. I created and updated print and digital projects under the supervision of the creative director. I was immersed in an agency style environment where I had the oppertunity to work alongside account managers, copywriters, and other designers. We developed captivating print projects that reflect the integrity of the USF graphic identity.

        <li>Evoba was my crash course into the world of design. I started this sole proprietorship as a means to experiment with branding, marketing, and graphic design. This project taught me financial accounting, e-commerce management, international sourcing, marketing, art file preparation, and web design; an invaluable first experience that I draw from today. Over the course of two years, I designed over 50 products, maintained a social media campaign and collaborated with other artists and manufacturers.
